# C# Practice Work (no projects)

## Overview
This repository contains my daily C# practice work as I work through core programming fundamentals. Each folder represents a day or concept, with small console applications focused on learning and clarity.

## What I’m Practicing
- Console input and output
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic (if / else)
- Loops (while)
- Basic program flow and user interaction

## Project Structure (WIP)
- **Day 1** – Simple calculator and basic output
- **Day 2** – Operators and user input
- **Day 3** – Interactive menu with branching paths and replay loop

## How to Run
These are console applications written in C#.
You can run them using:
- Visual Studio, or
- `dotnet run` from the project directory

## Notes
This repo is intentionally simple and focused on learning fundamentals. Code is written to prioritize readability and understanding over optimization. All work is completed by me.
